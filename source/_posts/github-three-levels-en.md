As far as I can see, GitHub users are also experiencing the three levels described in ["Poetic Remarks in the Human World"](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%BA%E9%97%B4%E8%AF%8D%E8%AF%9D) by Wang Kuo-wei.

*Level 1: Last night the west wind shriveled the green-clad trees. Alone I climb the high tower, to gaze my fill along the road to the horizon.*

As a new user, by any chance, you registered a GitHub account. You dont know what *Git, Push, Pull, Pull Request* and *Repository* are. Just like an innocent child, you run into a beach full of colorful shells, but you cant even name the colors.
You are the only one among your friends to play with GitHub. Surfing around the webpages, you feel a little bit lonely and sad.
Facing repositories stared in 5-digit figure and IDs followed by some *k*, you sighed, "When can I create a famous repo like that? When can I grow to be a top coder like him."

*Level 2: My clothes grow daily more loose, yet care I not. For you am I thus wasting away in sorrow and pain.*

You created your first *repo* to store your old naive code.
You created `your_id.github.io` and launched your technical blogging journey by `hexo` or `jekyll`.
Your first *pull request*, later your first incoming *pull request*.
Your first *issue*, later your first incoming *issue*.
You came up with an awesome idea, and thanks to *Google Search* and *StackOverflow*, you tackled one and another challenge, implemented one and another feature, and your open source project looks just like something.
There are 365 days in a year, and we found exactly 365 contribution tiles in your GitHub profile.
Others are complaining, "How can it be so hard to grow in tech?" You replied back, "Have you ever seen what is it like in GitHub on 4am?"

*Level 3: I sought her in the crowd a hundred, a thousand times. Suddenly with a turn of the head, I saw her. That one there where the lamplight was fading.*

Thank to *Time*, my good friend. One day, you found that your followers are some *k*, your new *repository* get 100+ watches on day one.
You once contributed code for `Apache`, you once implemented new features for `TensorFlow`, you once fixed bugs for `Linux`.
You gained some fame in Silicon Valley. Many people know you, you also know some of them. You and your friends meet online and offline, you drink and cheers, you talk and laugh.
In the annual QCon San Francisco Summit, you were interviewed by a blonde journalist, "Along your growing path, to whom do you want to say the biggest thanks?" The babe looks familiar, but you can't remember. Thought for a short while, you said slowly, "Thanks my parents, thanks GitHub".
