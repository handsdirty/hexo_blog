According to history records, Li Bai was born on January 15th (in Lunar Calendar) in 701 A.D. I checked the calendar, the birthday falls on Feburary 28 this year. I want to write an article, for my idol in boyhood, to celebrate his 1315th birthday.

The moment when I become fond of Li Bai happened in high school, when I realized he was also a recommended student like me.
The Chinese recommended students are those who have some outstanding speciality so that they are accepted by universities without the SAT of China. Thanks for Deng Xiaoping's saying "Computer Science education should start with babies", thanks to Shijiazhuang No.2 Middle School's self-lead self-developped quality education, I became a recommended student. To my surprise, Li Bai was also a recommended student. The traditional way for ancient Chinese to become officers is to take the Imperial Examination. But Li Bai skipped the exam and got an offer from the Imperial Academy. He achieved that by his poem talent, recommendation by Officer He Zhizhang, and approval by Emperor Tang Xuanzong. It is like my experience such as CS competitions, recommendation by the Chancellor, and approval by the Department of Education.

One reason why I admire Li Bai is that he was always rich.
Between his graduation and government job, he spent most of the time in traveling around China. It was popular for students to travel, study and make friends at that time. During the traveling years, most likely Li Bai didn't have job or salary. He should be well paid in the Imperial Academy, which is part of central government. Later his growth was limited there, Emperor Tang Xuanzong was very sorry and sent him away with a very generous alimony. The history named the scene "Gold gift and goodbye" (Ci Jin Fang Huan). In today's words, Li Bai was always financially free.

Li Bai is willful, very willful.
The most famous scene is that he asked Queen Yang Guifei to prepare pen and ink for him, asked Emperor Tang Xuanzong's closest assitant Gao Lishi to help him take his shoes off. If it is me, no matter how good I am, how careless I am, how much President Xi likes me, maybe I can ask our First Lady Peng to hand over me a pen, I probably won't ask President Xi's lead secretary to help with my shoes.
His willfulness appears in his attitude to the people in charge. And he wrote words when he left Chang-an unhappily: Why should I serve the power with lowered eyes and bent knees which makes me unhappy! (An Neng Cui Mei Zhe Yao Shi Quan Gui, Shi Wo Bu De Kai Xin Yan.)
His willfulness appears in his open attitude in spending money. Such attitude shows that he was highly confident and secure. Like he said: I was born to be a talent. After spending one thousand pieces of gold, I can easily make one thousand pieces more. (Tian Sheng Wo Cai Bi You Yong, Qian Jin San Jin Huan Fu Lai.)
A willful person is also a simple person.
He looks happy when he is happy. He looks unhappy when he is unhappy.
You can easily tell if he likes it or not.

Li Bai has a lot of hobbies.
Let's check what he was into at age 15.
When Li Bai was 15, he read many special books, and can write articles as good as Lin Xiangru. (Shi Wu Guan Qi Shu, Zuo Fu Ling Xiang Ru.)
When Li Bai was 15, he likes swording, and won a lot in games. (Shi Wu Hao Jian Shu, Bian Gan Zhu Hou.)
When Li Bai was 15, he likes immortal secret, and kept traveling to look for immortal secret. (Shi Wu You Shen Xian, Xian You Wei Ceng Xie.)
We can see that he had a cultural hobby which was reading. His input empowered him with great output as good writings.
He had a sports hobby which was swording, and did well in local competitions.
He had a spiritual hobby which was to be immortal, and he tried hard.
Besides those healthy hobbies, he had another two unhealthy hobbies: fighting and drinking. Though we now know that fighting is not good, and drinking should be controlled.

I always believe, people should have dreams.
According to my observation, Li Bai had 3 dreams: the dream to be a knight, the dream to be immortal, the dream to be a president. These 3 dreams still make sense in today's values. The knight dream is to pursue justice and world peace. The immortal dream is to pursue health and medicine improvement. The president dream is to have big impact.
Li Bai realized the knight dream.
For sure, he didn't become immortal who never die, but he had a solid foundation as a Taoist. And he did become immortal for his poems. The readers were shocked, and cried it must be written by some immortal who was demoted from the heaven. Li Bai also felt good, and wrote words: The immortal touched my head, and taught me the way to be immortal. (Xian Ren Fu Wo Ding, Jie Fa Shou Chang Sheng.)
About the president dream, unfortunately, he didn't get it. He tried really hard, but didn't get an opportunity. Though he did get an opportunity when he was old, and the opportunity almost killed him. A widely accepted explanation is that Li Bai's personality and speciality is not a good match to politics. What I learnt from it is that: good articles hates life winners. And people should choose a career which matches them, and it's recommended to develop a hobby which you are really into. So you can still have fun and be happy if you are unlucky at work.

The most precious thing left by Li Bai is his poem.
The poem is beyond imagination and very powerful. It passed over 1000 years. In moments of lives of Chinese people of countless generations, it described people feelings so vividly, and made us resonated and moved again and again.
Following are examples. I wrote down the feeling or scene, you can come up with suitable Li Bai's poem.
- I was like, I miss home. Ju Tou Wang Ming Yue, _______.
- I was like, hahaha, I am so good, your guys are so so. Yang Tian Da Xiao Chu Men Qu, _______.
- I was like, when I was travelling, I came to a big river. Huang He Zhi Shui Tian Shang Lai, _______.
- I was like, when I was travelling, I felt hungry. Ri Zhao Xiang Lu Sheng Zi Yan, _______. (I know this poem is borgus XD.)
- I was like, f*ck, I quit. An Neng Cui Mei Zhe Yao Shi Quan Gui, _______.
- I was like, I made a big deal, let's keep drinking. Ren Sheng De Yi Xu Jin Huan, _______.
- I was like, I had a dream last night, such and such. Hai Ke Tan Ying Zhou, _______.
- I was like, I am moved, thanks so much for coming to say goodbye. Tao Hua Tan Shui Shen Qian Chi, _______.
- I was like, come on, just buy it. Tian Sheng Wo Cai Bi You Yong, _______.
- I was like, about that thing, it's just so so. Shi Jian Xing Le Yi Ru Ci, _______.
- I was like, hi miss, you are so beautiful. Yun Xiang Yi Shang Hua Xiang Rong, _______.

Let me stop here. Otherwise the more I wrote, the more Li Bai will hate me.
Happy birthday to you, Li Bai!
