I specially chose the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) days to write about Feng Tang. Because I know that he must be writing a lot during this period of time. According to his description, besides the time he makes every day, he usually winds down during the Spring Festival to concentrate and write. And many of his works were finished in such periods. Another reason why I want to write about him is, I realized that Feng Tang's popularity is reaching the position of boys' idol in China today. I should start, right now.

In the past one year, I found that Feng Tang occupied the column sections of GQ China and For Him Magazine in China, and the best seller shelves in airport bookstores. He talked and laughed with Dou Wentao and Xu Zidong in Qiang Qiang San Ren Xing in Hong Kong Phoenix TV. He competed in public speaking with Luo Yonghao and piano playing with Zhao Yinyin in Sou Shen Ji, a Tencent original video series. He was mentioned and refererenced by my friends. His old and new articles were shared and liked by boys and girls in social networks. His poem were used by me and my then-GF as personal signitures:

*Spring water begins to flow, and spring woods furiously grow.*
*Spring breeze from afar wafts here, but pales before my lady dear.*

The main idea is that: it feels so good. How good? The spring breeze is like the girl's finger touch on your face. I walked in the spring breeze for 10 miles. Good enough, right? Still not as good as being together with you.
This is Feng Tang's poem.

We admire Feng Tang.
Among professional writers, he is the only one whose works probably won't be mentioned during introduction, but instead, his resume will be rephrased. Even if Feng Tang never writes, he is already a successful figure under normal standards. And he achieved several successes in various domains.
What professions will America's best high school students choose? Lawyers and doctors. Feng Tang completed the 8-year Doctor of Medicine in Peking Union Medical College and he specialized in Gynecologic Oncology. But he had to face deaths very often which made him sad and blue.
What will the Chinese top scorers and Olympics champaigns choose as majors for college? Many of them will choose the business schools in Tshinghua U or PKU, and later go to Wall Street investment banks, hedge funds or consulting firms. Mr. Feng graudated from an American business school with MBA, worked ten years in McKinsey and left as a partner. Many fans imagine that if they can take 100+ flights every year, commute between CBD and 5-star hotels every day and sometimes walk fast on 5th avenue with a decent business suit, they must confidently believe they are already successful.
In writing, Feng Tang's achievements are also recognized by most people. "People's Literature" ranked him as No.1 in the Top 20 Great Masters of the Future. And I believe that even comparing with modern writers, Feng Tang's works will most likely be more valuable as time passes. He introduced the concept of "Feng Tang's Golden Line". The idea is that there is a line to divide writers to two groups based on achievements of their works. And the experts can measure writers by the line at first glance. It is like the same thing like, who are the real heros in Three Kingdoms, is someone really something, etc. It becomes very obvious to judge someone under such questions. And Feng Tang's own works, should be obviously above the Golden Line.
Feng Tang is also an expert in ancient artifacts and specializes in jade which is a symbol for gentlemen in ancient China. According to his own words, he has a private motivation for this hobby which is to help him improve writing by researching how ancient people defined beauty.

Feng Tang like everything we like.
We like girls, Feng Tang likes. And he even wrote a book "Give me a girl when I was 18" which wrote our hearts out and the unrealized dreams.
We like drinking, Feng Tang likes. Once in a dinner with Beijing professional writers, he dranked 0.5L Chinese Liquor (Er Guo Tou) and was down. He was then performed stomach lavage in Peking Union Hospital by classmates. Those medical school classmates laughed at the miserable drunk Feng Tang, "Haha, how could you know you have such a day."
We likes "bragging", Feng Tang likes (I guess). And writing is a great approach to talk freely, big and lastly.

Feng Tang satisfied our imagination about life.
We want to make big money. He did. We want to be famous. He did, and accumulated a lot of loyal girl fans.
We want to travel around the world. He has been to most of the interesting places on earth, and then write to suggest places to live in.
We want to be immortal. He firstly achieved the successes which other people needs several life times to struggle for, and then beated the time by writing.
We want to be regarded as good people. He was a doctor who saved lifes. He worked hard to cure cancer, fighted at the very front line of modern medicine, for the sake of mankind's well-being.

Feng Tang demonstrated noble values.
His various success quietly complies the "Three Immortal" believed by literati officialdom in ancient China: Li De, Li Gong and Li Yan (I will write about the concept in the future).
The noble values should contain the love for one's motherland. After working for McKinsey for 10 years, Feng Tang joined one of the earlist founded state-owned companies to contribute for motherland.
The noble values should have dreams. Feng Tang's dreams about the upcoming life is to use up himself as a writing genius, to see what more he could achieve, and to turn the inside feelings to words.

Facing the avid fans and the admiration to his life, Feng Tang sometimes has to answer some life-mentor-style questions. And he did pointed a road, a broad road. Nine years ago when he and ex-wife were interviewed by Hong Kong Phoenix TV, he said in the end, "It is actually simple. Just check what you are good at and what you should do. Then work on it really hard, and work on it happily. Don't care about the outcomes. You will get something, for sure."

Finally, many readers may raise a question: you wrote so much about him, do you Song Zhe want to be another Feng Tang?
Haha, of course not. I will be myself.
