With the background music of "Unforgettable Tonight" in *Karaoke Room 110 of Cupertino Music Channel*, Sir. Song Zhe and his friends welcomed the new year 2016. Later, Song's party jumped into 5 cars parked in a row next to each other, started the engines and drove into 2016. If our Camera Boy Song happended to be there, he must have gently pressed the shutter, and saved the scene which was a 99% reproduce of the movie scene in "The Fast and the Furious".

During the New Year's vacation, we are very happy and honorabe to invite Sir. Song Zhe to Playboy Weekly for a special interview. Following is the interview notes.

Q: Senior Journalist Song Zhe
A: Honorable Guest Song Zhe

Q: Happy New Year! Sir. Song.
A: Happy New Year! Journalist Song.
Q: Long time no see. Our last interview with you can be recalled back to three years ago, when you were organizer and chief editor of "A Byte of Flyers: USTC CS 2008 Overseas Students Summary on Graduate School Application". Time flies.
A: Yes, time flies. Three years was gone quietly. The then Student Song has got a job and started working in real societies.
Q: You know what. We call it "debut" in our circles. Debut early is not a bad thing actually. By the way, there are a lot of vacation days during Christmas and New Year. Did you travel?
A: I was mostly resting at home during vacation reading books such as "Biography of Elon Musk", "Gui Chui Deng", watching "Empresses in the Palace" (Zhen Huan Zhuan) and Xi Shuo Qian Long, cooking some dinners and also running. My VIP friend Honglei Liu visited me from Santa Barbara, we played video games, had hotpot, and enjoyed my second bottle of Wu Liang Ye of last year. Btw, I was learning snowboarding and went to Lake Tahoe four times. But I am still doing green lanes which is kind of slow.

Q: Four times! You are really hard working. Oh, I should now say congratulations for your promotion (fist closed to salute)! You achived it in just one year and three months, are there any secret tips to share? With one level up, how many people are you managing now?
A: Thanks (fist closed to salute back). Your news is so quick. It is the software engineer level from 3 to 4, and the next level 5 is so-called senior software engineer. Oh, still not managing people, not even close to it. The tech level promotion, is kind of like, tech track tittle which is different from the management track. To talk about experiences, I would say, hard working, and luck. Luo Ji Si Wei once mentioned, the success of 20s is that someone wants to lead and teach you, the success of 30s is that boss rely on your talents, the success of 40s is that people want to follow you, and the success of 50s is that you have many successfully former apprentices, students and followers all over the world. I am very lucky to encounter two tech leads who are very professional, graduated from noble top schools, and willing to lead and teach new comers. My boss is very powerful, he shared a lot of experiences, and knows really well about the arts of "Carrot and Stick". My teammates are really awesome too! Actually the promotion time differences from level 3 to level 4 from case to case are just around half year. Not a big deal. Compared with the long career of dozens of years, there are many other more important skills to hone.

Q: Make sense. I heard that you visited China recently, any news or thoughts to share? Did you "enjoy" the fog haze (snicker ...)?
A: Haha, not really. I chose September and October on purpose. The autumn sky is clear and the air is crisp in North China. In a place like Beijing where the polution can only be relieved by winds, it will be sunny as long as there are winds. One unfortunate thing, my visa application was checked. It's my carelessness. I didn't foresee any problem because my last application was so smooth. I was wondering, my background is so clear, well, don't you know what my company is? So I went to the Embassy even without a resume. Later, I was stuck in China, under mixed feelings. You may call it a happy miserable.
I met a lot of people this time. I onced published my *agenda* which you can find in my Wechat friend circles. Some of the highlights are as the following:
My meeting with Zhiwei Qiu, an investment banker in China CITIC Bank. He found my post on attending Xiang Sheng Show in De Yun She, and contacted me saying that we should meet, but the problem is that, he will be on a business trip the next morning. I asked when he could be back. He replied he was not sure about *return date*. I said that I was not sure about my *departure date*, and we should just meet, right now. At that time, the Metro already shut down. I stopped a taxi and went to He Ping Li. Once I arrived in his apartment, I found that there was everything, but it was really messed up. So this is the scenario of people who make tons of money, but don't even have time to enjoy life. We had great night chats, but the time was so short that we had to get up around 5am so that he could catch up the flight.

Q: Haha, so the story is, you tooked a taxi to a financial playboy's home, stayed overnight, and came out 5:30am the next morning. Go ahead.
A: Well, it actually is.
Another one is my visit to Xu Zhang, my kindergarden and primary school classmate, who is also a senior analyst in Analysys (Yi Guan Zhi Ku). He is now kind of a public figure. He showed up in Beijing TV several times last year, and also accept interviews from medias to provide professional comments on industry news. He mainly focuses on mobile internet, so there was rich information in our conversations. I really learned a lot from him about our industry in Beijing.

Another one is very interesting, I met a hair stylist who took care of my head shaving. I am not kidding. He has been doing it for over 10 years, and can be called senior and successful in his profession. And I am really moved by his confidence and attitude. He is really handsome, and bragged that there are so many girls pursuing him. He even got meal boxes three meals a day, with no duplicates. We feel very congenial about each other. We drinked several times, and he also brought me to the nigth club in Wu Dao Kou.
Besides those stuff, most of my primary school and junior high school classmates are working in Huabei Oilfield or the general petrol system. My high school classmates are mostly in U.S. or Beijing. My college classmates are stilling reading PhDs, or just started working after graduate school, most of the ones who started working right after college did one job-hopping. Because of the industry, most of them are in Beijing. We talked a lot, about our stories, and the industry.
As time is limited, let me stop here about my China trip. I saw some more questions in your card, right?

Q: Ok, ok. Are your parents doing well?
A: They are doing great. Thank you! This time I found they are in better physical and metal statuses, so I am really happy.
Q: You may write a blog post about your China trip. I will be the first one to read it. It would be even better if it can be published in our magazine.
A: It's so good to have a journalist friend. Please let me think about it.

Q: Haha. It's because Bro. Song is so popular and love making friends. You must visited many friends or be visited by them. Can you talk about it?
A: Yes, I met a lot.
I think I am a top one who keep tight relationships with my old and remote friends. I met Kai Xing twice (Sillicon Valley and Beijing), Yu Tao twice (he came from London for business trip), Tianyu Gao (Los Angeles), Meng Lin (many video chats, severals meets in Beijing), Kaifei Chen and Qifan Pu (Berkeley), Peng Kang (San Francisco), Honglei Liu (Santa Barbara and Sillicon Valley), Shenquan Qu (several phone calls, and Beijing meet). Sigh, so many, I don't think I can count them all.
I gave a lot of campus tours in our company, such as with Qiaochu Zhang (from New York).
Met a lot of elite colleagues and friends in internal activities, such as senior managers, self-driving car engineers, UX & PM people, and many peers.
Made a lot of friends during fun activities.
Btw, one dinner was for 10 year anniversary of entrance to Shijiazhuang No.2 Middle School.
I also made a lot of phone calls (very effective communication), and had many meals with local friends.

Q: Great! Now, talk about the fun activities?
A: Let me see ...
Great America, LA Auto Show, Paintball, Halloween Horror Room, Concert of Chen Xiaochun & Zheng Yijian, Glass Blowing, Performing Actor Class. Several hikings, several movies. Several grilled fishes, several dim sums, many Chinese restaurant visits, several In&out burgers.
About drinking, I had several great times last year. It's very lucky that Chong Wang and Ming Xiao live nearby. It's very lucky to meet friends who are willing to be drunk. People who drink must can understand my words.
A very successful series of activities, that we called a group of friends to watch the Voice of China. Really awesome.
I also organized a watching party in my company for Chinese employees to watch Beijing March. I was a little concerned when drafting the email, it sounds really bad if the Japanese colleagues know that we organized to watch Celebration March for Anti-Japanense War. So I renamed the event to be Watching Party of World War II Celebration March. Well, as China and U.S. are both victory countries, it must be ok no matter what.

Q: Haha, smart move. I know that you love reading. Any great books you read last year?
A: Books I finished reading: "Team Geek" on software developping teamwork, "Huo Zhe Huo Zhe Jiu Lao Le" by Feng Tang, "Expert Adversor Programming" about programmatic trading. To my shame, I only read 3 books last year. Accidentally, it is just one book each for IT, literature and finance. I bought tons of books, and the books I am reading should be more than 10. Hope I can finish reading more books in the coming year.

Q: Mr. Song, you know that our "Playboy Weekly Magazine" writes about gossips. We all know you are a romantic gentleman, can you share some personal affairs?
A: Haha, I know you are going to ask that. Well, let's keep it short, it is also a protection to me. Anyway, such and such, I am availalbe again now. Yeah!
Q: We know there are few girls in bay area. We understand. Actually, there are many hot girls in our press. Want me to introduce? What kind of girls do you like?
A: Big breasts! Big breasts! Big breasts! 

Q: Important things should repeat three times. You know something, haha. But I cannot tell the breast size in winter, they are wearing too much.
Well, last question. What are your new year resolutions?
A: New year resolutions don't need to be many. One or two is enough. I want to be a decent blog writer. I have been desiring to do it for years. It would be really good if I can achieve it. But it is hard to start. Fortunately, I wrote one at the end of 2015, [my first blog post](2015/12/30/my-first-pull-request/). Now I have a writing plan of [over 10 topics](https://github.com/handsdirty/handsdirty.github.io/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+). And my new domain name is coming soon. Let me see, one post a week is kind of the limit for a writer's mental status, I should also not be quiet for over one month. There are 52 weeks a year, then let me write at least 26 blogs in 2016.
Q: Great! We are looking forward to it. Wish you a great success! Happy New Year!
A: Happy New Year!
