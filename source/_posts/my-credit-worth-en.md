Yang Lan onced interviewed Heavenly King Andy Lau (actor Liu Dehua), "In your 30+ years careers, is there any secret to success?" Andy Lau said, "Only one thing that I am really proud of, which is my credit."

As no one won top prize of US lottery Power Ball last Saturday, it creates a record-breaking high prize which makes the lottery a positive-expectation investment and triggered a lottery madness across the US. After 10+ years, in my favorite 7-11 store, I bought a lottery ticket again. After sharing in my wechat frend circle, two friends on China trip vacations asked me to buy it for them. So I started reselling lottery.

I posted an announcement: "Now selling the only positive expectation lottery in history, Power Ball. Accept both domestic and international orders. $2 each, no extra fees. Give me a number, or we do it randomly. I will send out pictures after I get the tickets. I don't take a cut, you get all the prizes if it happens. Tips is welcomed. In case I checked the wrong numbers, I won't refund or pay your loss. I got 2 orders already!"
During operation, my clients send me money via wechat mobile payment, aka Hong Bao. I buy it, photo it and send the message. Usually, I will take pictures with a latest newspaper, San Jose Mercury News or USA Today, so it feels more historic.

Then I started promotions in my wechat groups: my college group and my high school group. I also replied a thread in my company's misc maillist. Actually, per my colleagues' request, I started a pool. Using Google Form for sign-up and Google Wallet for payment, all participants can share the total prizes, so everyone gets a better chance. Unfornately, it violates company policy that we cannot organize employees for gambling. So I have to stop it. During the several minutes life time of my pool, I already got 8 payments into my account, which I have to refund.
My global revenue is 222 USD, so I am definitely the forerunner of international lottery resales business. With 111 (for clients) + 3 (for myself) tickets at hands, I am taking over the biggest advantage facing the biggest opportunity this year.

In this lottery madness, almost all of my US classmates involved, almost all of my teammates bought in. It is very rare, especially for foreigners like us in US. During my visits to 7-11 and Safeway, everyone was doing it so that they don't miss the chance to join a historic event.

Finally, someone in southcal Chino Hills (near LA) won the top prize, while my clients and I are not so lucky. But it is not a bad thing. Actually, most top prize winners didn't end up well. Because easy money goes easily. I am happy that I don't have to deal with my lawyer for the mixed relations. By law, such resales still count me as the owner, and I can only give the prize to my client as a gift. So it is double taxed.
Interestingly, there are 3 four-dollar prizes whose frequency is 1/38. It is very close to the theory chance published on Power Ball website: 1/38.32

The biggest benefits from this event is that it gives everyone a moment to rethink their dreams. Think about it, what's your plan if you win. Among my colleagues, one said she will invite every team members to any place on the earth for vacation; another teammate said he will take the prize over 30 years, share first year's money with team, share second year's money with familiy, but he is not sure if he can survive the first two years' raids. A girl said she will buy an island. A boy said he will buy the Lakers.
My posted plan is to be full-time blogger. By coincidence, Miss USTC Niu Niu also wants to be a full-time blogger, and she plans to buy global famous bloggers to advertise for her.

The biggest benefit for me is that, my credit value now raises up to 1.5 billion. Among all my clients, they do trust me not to run away with the top prize, so that they buy it from me. Yes, given a single choice between 1.5 billion and my credit, I will definitely choose my credit.
In this world, there are wealth which is way more valuable than money, and careers which is way more interesting than making money.
